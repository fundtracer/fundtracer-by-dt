## Why Add a Custom Search Engine?

FundTracer now supports browser custom search engines — the fastest way to analyze a wallet. Instead of opening the app, navigating, and pasting an address, you can type "ft" in your address bar, press Tab, paste, and hit Enter. The analysis loads instantly with no clicks.

## How It Works

- Type "ft", press Tab, paste any wallet address (e.g. 0xf8a319bcd9fff599c191f30eb7b2c876067cb2ad)
- Or paste a full explorer URL from Etherscan, Lineascan, Arbiscan, Basescan, or Solscan
- FundTracer auto-detects the chain from the URL and opens the correct analysis page
- Free plan users can scan Linea addresses instantly; Pro users get all chains
- No clicks, no navigation — just type, paste, enter

## 20-Second Setup (Chrome)

1. Open Chrome Settings → Search Engine → Manage Search Engines
2. Click "Add"
3. Name: FundTracer
4. Keyword: ft
5. URL: https://fundtracer.xyz/search?q=%s
6. Click Save

## Firefox and Edge
- Firefox: Right-click the address bar → "Add a Keyword for this Search". Or go to Settings → Search — FundTracer is auto-detected if you've visited the site.
- Edge: Same setup as Chrome — both use the same search engine settings path.

## Supported Explorer URLs

The search engine auto-detects the chain when you paste a full explorer URL:
- etherscan.io → Ethereum
- lineascan.build → Linea
- arbiscan.io → Arbitrum
- basescan.org → Base
- polygonscan.com → Polygon
- bscscan.com → BNB Chain
- solscan.io → Solana

## Try It Now

Once set up, type "ft" + Tab, paste any of these and hit Enter:
- 0xf8a319bcd9fff599c191f30eb7b2c876067cb2ad (raw Linea address)
- https://lineascan.build/address/0xf8a319bcd9fff599c191f30eb7b2c876067cb2ad (Linea explorer)
- https://etherscan.io/address/0x1f9090aaE28b8a3dCeaDf281B0F12828e676c326 (Ethereum explorer)

## Earn Equity by Analyzing Wallets

Today we're launching our equity claim system — a 5% equity pool worth potentially life-changing returns for our most active community members.

## The Equity Pool

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Pool | 500,000 points = 5% equity |
| Per Wallet Analyzed | 10 points |
| Equity per Point | 0.00001% |

## How It Works

1. **Analyze Wallets** — Use FundTracer to analyze any wallet on any supported chain
2. **Earn Points** — Each analysis earns you 10 points (tracked via Torque)
3. **Track Progress** — Visit My Stats in the Rewards page
4. **Claim Equity** — Once you have points, click "Claim" to record your equity

## Example Calculations

| Wallets Analyzed | Points | Equity |
|------------------|--------|--------|
| 10 | 100 | 0.001% |
| 100 | 1,000 | 0.01% |
| 1,000 | 10,000 | 0.1% |
| 10,000 | 100,000 | 1% |

## Where to Claim

Navigate to **Rewards > My Stats** to see your position and claim button:

- Wallets Analyzed: Your scan count
- Points: wallets × 10
- Equity: points × 0.00001%
- Claim Button: Appears when you have > 0 points

## Leaderboard

The leaderboard tracks top performers. Our top analyzers:

1. Haicon Empire — 2,080 pts
2. Fuhad Kamil-Bello — 600 pts
3. Alli Odelade — 530 pts

Can you overtake them?

## What's Next

- More chain support for point earning
- Achievement badges
- Group competitions
- Referral bonuses

## Claim System 2.0

We've heard your feedback and made major improvements to our equity claim system. The new version includes multiple claims, real-time updates, and a much better user experience.

## What's New

### Multiple Claims
The biggest change: you can now claim equity multiple times! Previously, users could only claim once. Now:

- Earn points by analyzing wallets
- Claim your equity when ready
- Continue earning and claim again

This "accumulate and claim" model means you're never locked out of earning more equity.

### Real-Time Stats
We've fixed several issues with the Rewards page hero section:

- **Active Participants** — Now shows actual count from leaderboard
- **Rewards Claimed** — Now fetches from pool stats endpoint to show actual distributed percentage (no more "0%")

### Claim History
Every claim is now tracked with a full history:

- See all your past claims
- View dates and amounts claimed
- Track total equity earned over time

### Better UI States
- **Close button** — X icon to dismiss the claimed view
- **Back to Stats** — Button to return after claiming
- **All Claimed state** — Shows "View Claimed Equity (X%)" with hint to earn more
- **Auto-dismiss errors** — Error messages clear after 5 seconds

## Technical Improvements

### Cache Invalidation
Every successful claim now invalidates relevant Redis caches:

- Claim status cache
- User stats cache  
- Leaderboard cache
- Pool stats cache

This ensures the UI updates immediately after claiming.

### Error Handling
The claim history endpoint now gracefully handles errors:

- Returns empty history instead of 500 error
- Prevents UI from breaking on server issues

## How to Use

1. **Earn Points** — Analyze wallets on FundTracer
2. **Visit My Stats** — Go to Rewards > My Stats
3. **Claim Equity** — Click "Claim X% Equity" button
4. **View Details** — Click "View Claimed Equity" to see your claims
5. **Earn More** — Analyze more wallets, claim again!

## Example Flow

| Action | Points | Equity Claimed |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Analyze 3 wallets | 30 | 0.00030% |
| First claim | — | 0.00030% |
| Analyze 5 more | 50 | 0.00050% claimable |
| Second claim | — | 0.00050% more |
| **Total claimed** | 80 | **0.00080%** |

## Behind the Scenes

This update involved changes across the stack:

- **Frontend** — MyStatsTab.tsx with new state management
- **Backend** — TorqueServiceV2.ts with cache invalidation
- **API** — New claim/history endpoint
- **Styling** — New CSS for claim history section

Happy analyzing!

    readTime: '3 min read',
    author: 'FundTracer Team',
    slug: 'unified-solana-evm-ui',
    content: `
## Why We Unified the UI

When users switch between our EVM and Solana analysis apps, they expect a consistent experience. Our original App-Solana used a different navigation pattern — feature grid with overlay panels — while App-EVM used the familiar sidebar + tabs shell that users know from our main app.

Today, we have fixed that.

## Before vs After

### Before: Feature Grid Layout
- 2D button grid (10 features)
- Click to open slide-in overlay panel
- Address input stayed at top
- No persistent navigation

### After: Shell-Based Navigation  
- Sidebar with tabs (like App-EVM)
- Tab content switches inline
- Address in topbar search
- Consistent AppShell component

## New Structure

| Tab | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| Portfolio | Token holdings, SOL balance, staking |
| Transactions | History with filters |
| NFTs | Gallery view |
| DeFi | Protocol positions |
| Risk | Security analysis |
| Identity | Badges & reputation |
| Analytics | Dune data |
| Tax | P&L positions |
| Compare | Multi-wallet |
| History | Timeline |
| EVM | Link to App-EVM |

## Topbar Search

The key addition: a unified search bar that:
- Shows SOL chain badge (no network selector needed)
- Accepts Solana addresses
- Press Enter to analyze
- Persists in URL params

## Technical Changes

- Created 10 new view components in \`design-system/features/Solana*View.tsx\`
- Added search props to AppShell component
- Updated route to use new AppSolanaPage
- Consistent CSS using existing AppShell tokens

## Why This Matters

1. **Familiar UX** — Users know the pattern from App-EVM
2. **Easier navigation** — Tabs > clicking through overlays
3. **Faster switching** — No panels to open/close
4. **Consistent code** — Reuses AppShell component

Try it now: Go to FundTracer Solana and notice the new sidebar.

    content: 'Why We Integrated Dune SIM: Blockchain data APIs are hard. You need to manage multiple RPC endpoints, handle rate limits, normalize data across different chains, and keep everything in sync. That is where Dune SIM comes in. What is Dune SIM: SIM is Dune real-time blockchain data API. It gives you instant access to Wallet balances across 60 plus EVM chains and Solana, Transaction history with full raw transaction data, Token metadata with USD pricing, and Liquidity data for spam filtering. All through a single API key. No indexer setup required. How We are Using It: We have integrated SIM as our primary data source for Solana wallet analysis. Token Balances - slash beta svm balances gives us real-time SPL token holdings with USD values. Transaction History - slash beta svm transactions returns complete transaction data. Spam Filtering - Built-in exclude_spam_tokens parameter filters low-liquidity tokens. The Integration: We built a DuneSimClient wrapper that handles API authentication with X-Sim-Api-Key header, Cursor-based pagination for large result sets, Caching (60s for balances, 5min for transactions), and Automatic fallback to RPC on SIM failure. Why SIM Over RPC: SIM includes USD values - RPC needs extra calls. SIM returns symbols, names, decimals - RPC needs more calls. SIM handles 60 plus chains - RPC is 1 per endpoint. SIM has built-in liquidity filtering - custom logic otherwise. The Hackathon Angle: This integration was built for the Dune SIM Hackathon. We are using SIM endpoints to power Real-time portfolio values, Transaction history with proper timestamps, and Token spam filtering toggle in the UI. All while maintaining fallback to traditional RPC when SIM is unavailable. What is Next: We are just getting started. With SIM webhook subscriptions, we can build Real-time balance change alerts, Portfolio tracking notifications, and Multi-chain portfolio views (Solana plus Ethereum). Try it now: Go to FundTracer Solana and search any wallet. The data is powered by Dune SIM.',

    title: 'FundTracer v2: The Leaderboard That Actually Works',

    author: 'FundTracer Team',
    slug: 'fundtracer-v2-leaderboard-rebuilt',
    content: `
## Why We Rebuilt Everything

Our v1 leaderboard had potential but hit real problems:
- Multiple campaigns created confusion
- Expensive rank queries (full collection scans)
- Firebase quota issues (49K reads/day)
- N+1 query problems

We needed something simpler. One leaderboard. One metric. Production-ready.

## The v2 Architecture

### Firestore Schema (New)
\`\`\`javascript
// Collection: torque_wallets/{userId}
{
  walletsScanned: number,    // THE metric
  totalPoints: number,     // scanned * 10
  rank: number,          // calculated ON WRITE
  displayName: string
}
\`\`\`

### Key Innovation: Rank on Write, Not Read

**Old (v1):** Calculate rank every time a user checks stats
\`\`\`javascript
const rank = await db.collection('torque_user_stats')
  .where('points', '>', userPoints)
  .count()  // Full collection scan = expensive!
\`\`\`

**New (v2):** Calculate rank when user scans
\`\`\`javascript
await incrementScan(userId);
await recalculateRanks();  // One-time batch update
\`\`\`

This shifts O(read requests) to O(write events). Since writes are rare (~100/day) vs reads (~1000/day), we save ~95% of Firestore reads.

## Performance Results

| Metric | v1 | v2 | Reduction |
|--------|-----|-----|-----------|
| Daily Firestore Reads | ~49,000 | ~700 | **98%** |
| Leaderboard Queries | ~5,000 | ~96 | **98%** |
| Rank Calculations | Expensive each time | Cached | **100%** |

## What Changed

1. **Single leaderboard** - Wallet Analyzer only
2. **Clean API** - /api/torque/v2/*
3. **Redis caching** - 5 min TTL
4. **Telegram commands** - /rewardslb and /personalrewardslb
5. **Stable refresh** - 60 seconds (won't hit quota)

## The Result

A leaderboard that:
- Updates in real-time
- Works in Telegram groups
- Doesn't hit Firebase quotas
- Scales with more users

## Try It Out

1. Scan a wallet at fundtracer.xyz
2. Check your rank: /personalrewardslb in Telegram
3. View the leaderboard: /rewardslb

The leaderboard updates within 5 seconds of your scan.

    content: `
## What is Sybil Attack?

A Sybil attack occurs when a single entity creates multiple fake identities (called Sybils) to manipulate a blockchain network. In the context of cryptocurrency, this often means creating numerous wallet addresses to:

- Manipulate governance voting outcomes
- Inflate trading volumes artificially
- Exploit airdrop programs
- Create fake social proof for projects

## How Sybil Detection Works

Sybil detection uses various techniques to identify coordinated wallet activity:

### 1. Transaction Pattern Analysis

Analyzes when transactions occur. Wallets that consistently execute transactions in the same block often indicate bot activity.

### 2. Funding Source Clustering

Groups wallets that share common funding sources. If multiple wallets receive funds from the same source, they may be controlled by the same entity.

### 3. Behavioral Similarity

Compares transaction patterns across wallets. Similar timing, amounts, and destinations can indicate coordinated behavior.

### 4. Gas Usage Patterns

Analyzes gas spending behavior. Bots often have consistent gas patterns that differ from regular users.

## Common Sybil Indicators

- Same-block transactions from multiple wallets
- Shared funding sources
- Similar transaction timing
- Uniform token transfer patterns
- New wallets with similar behavior

## Why Sybil Detection Matters

Detecting Sybil activity is crucial for:

- **Airdrop Distribution**: Ensuring tokens reach legitimate users
- **Governance**: Preventing vote manipulation
- **Security**: Identifying potential threats
- **Analytics**: Accurate user metrics

## Using FundTracer for Sybil Detection

FundTracer provides a comprehensive Sybil detection feature that analyzes wallet clusters and provides risk scores. Simply input wallet addresses to identify potential Sybil activity.

## What is Airdrop Farming?

Airdrop farming involves creating multiple wallet addresses to maximize airdrop rewards from blockchain projects. Projects use these rewards to incentivize early adoption, but farmers exploit this by creating fake activity.

## How Projects Detect Airdrop Farmers

### 1. Wallet Clustering

Projects analyze wallet clusters to find wallets controlled by the same entity:

- Shared funding sources
- Similar transaction patterns
- Gas fee correlations

### 2. Behavioral Analysis

Legitimate users and farmers have different behaviors:

- **Farmers**: Consistent, automated patterns
- **Users**: Varied, unpredictable patterns

### 3. On-Chain Metrics

Projects analyze:

- Transaction timing
- Gas usage patterns
- Contract interaction diversity
- Wallet age

### 4. Cross-Reference Analysis

Looking for:

- Wallets that only interact with one protocol
- Coordinated activity patterns
- Unusual transaction volumes

## Common Detection Methods

### Same-Block Detection

Farmers often use bots that execute multiple transactions in the same block. This creates a detectable pattern.

### Funding Correlation

Wallets funded from the same source are likely controlled by the same entity.

### Gas Pattern Analysis

Bots typically have consistent gas prices and limits.

### Interaction Similarity

Farmers often interact with the same contracts in similar patterns.

## How to Avoid Detection

If you're farming (not recommended), consider:

- Using different funding sources
- Varying transaction timing
- Avoiding automated tools
- Creating natural-looking patterns

## The Bottom Line

Projects are increasingly sophisticated in detecting farming. The best strategy is to be a genuine user rather than trying to game the system.

## Understanding Wallet Risk Scores

A wallet risk score is a numerical assessment that indicates the potential risk level associated with a cryptocurrency wallet address. Think of it as a credit score for blockchain wallets - it helps you quickly evaluate whether a wallet is trustworthy before making transactions.

Risk scores typically range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating greater risk. Some systems use letter grades (A-F) or simple labels (Low/Medium/High).

## How Wallet Risk Scores Work

Wallet risk scoring algorithms analyze multiple factors to determine risk:

### 1. Transaction Patterns

The algorithm examines:
- Transaction frequency and timing
- Average transaction sizes
- Patterns consistent with bot activity
- Same-block transaction patterns

### 2. Fund Sources

Analysis includes:
- Origin of initial funding
- Connection to known entities (exchanges, mixers)
- Funding from high-risk sources
- Cross-chain bridge usage

### 3. Contract Interactions

Scoring considers:
- Types of protocols interacted with
- Smart contract deployment
- Interaction with known malicious contracts
- DeFi protocol usage patterns

### 4. Behavioral Indicators

- Wallet age and activity history
- Similarity to known Sybil clusters
- Coordinated activity with other wallets
- Unusual token holding patterns

## Risk Score Ranges

| Score Range | Risk Level | Action Required |
|-------------|------------|------------------|
| 0-39 | Low Risk | Proceed normally |
| 40-59 | Medium Risk | Standard precautions |
| 60-79 | High Risk | Exercise caution |
| 80-100 | Critical Risk | Avoid transactions |

## What Factors Increase Risk Score

### High Risk Indicators

- **Mixer Usage:** Interaction with Tornado Cash or other mixers
- **New Wallets:** Recently created addresses with large transactions
- **Same-Block Activity:** Consistent same-block transactions suggest bots
- **Shared Funding:** Wallets funded from the same source
- **Known Scams:** Interaction with flagged malicious contracts

### Low Risk Indicators

- **Age:** Long-standing wallet with consistent activity
- **CEX Deposits:** Funding from verified exchanges
- **Diverse Interactions:** Usage of reputable DeFi protocols
- **Clean History:** No interaction with suspicious contracts

## Why Wallet Risk Scores Matter

### For Investors

- Verify source of funds before investment
- Identify whale wallets to follow
- Assess counterparty risk in DeFi transactions

### For Projects

- Detect airdrop farmers
- Identify Sybil attacks in governance
- Filter for legitimate users

### For Compliance

- Screen wallet addresses
- Meet AML requirements
- Document due diligence

### For Traders

- Identify potential pump-and-dump wallets
- Follow smart money indicators
- Avoid scam tokens

## Using Wallet Risk Scores Effectively

### Best Practices

1. **Don't rely solely on scores** - Use them as one input in your decision-making
2. **Understand the methodology** - Different tools use different algorithms
3. **Check multiple factors** - Look at the underlying data behind the score
4. **Consider context** - A high score might be legitimate depending on use case

### Red Flags to Watch

- Risk score doesn't match wallet behavior
- Score changes dramatically in short period
- Critical risk score for well-known entities (likely false positive)

## FundTracer's Risk Scoring

FundTracer provides comprehensive risk scoring that combines multiple factors:

- Multi-chain analysis across 8 blockchain networks
- Sybil detection to identify coordinated activity
- Funding source analysis
- Contract interaction history
- Behavioral pattern recognition

Try it free at fundtracer.xyz and learn more about our Risk Scoring documentation.

## Conclusion

Wallet risk scores are a powerful tool for making informed decisions in the crypto space. They provide a quick way to assess potential risks, but should be used as part of a broader due diligence process.

Understanding how these scores work helps you make better decisions and avoid common pitfalls in cryptocurrency transactions.

## What is a Funding Tree?

A funding tree (also called a funding graph or transaction tree) is a visual representation of how funds flow into and out of a cryptocurrency wallet. It shows the origin of funds, the intermediaries they passed through, and where they ultimately ended up.

Think of it as a family tree for money - you can see the lineage of every token, tracing it back to its source.

## Why Funding Trees Matter

Understanding fund flows is crucial for:

### Due Diligence

Before making a transaction, you want to know: "Where did this money come from?" A funding tree reveals the complete history.

### Investigations

Security researchers and investigators use funding trees to trace stolen funds, identify scammers, and build cases.

### Compliance

Anti-money laundering (AML) requirements often necessitate understanding fund sources.

### Research

Analyzing fund flows helps understand market dynamics, whale movements, and protocol usage.

## Reading a Funding Tree

### Understanding the Structure

In a typical funding tree visualization:

- **Central node:** The wallet you are analyzing
- **Parent nodes:** Sources of funds (where money came from)
- **Child nodes:** Destinations of funds (where money went)
- **Edges (lines):** Show the direction and amount of flow

### Node Types

Different entities are typically color-coded:

| Entity Type | Description | Common Color |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| Centralized Exchange (CEX) | Binance, Coinbase, etc. | Orange/Amber |
| Decentralized Exchange (DEX) | Uniswap, Raydium, etc. | Purple |
| Bridge | Cross-chain bridges | Cyan |
| Mixer | Privacy mixers | Red/Pink |
| Smart Contract | DeFi protocols | Indigo |
| Regular Wallet | Personal addresses | Green |

### Edge Information

The lines connecting nodes typically show:
- Amount transferred
- Token type
- Timestamp

### Depth Levels

Funding trees can show multiple generations or depth levels:

- **Level 1:** Direct sources/destinations
- **Level 2:** Sources of sources
- **Level 3+:** Deeper history

## Practical Example

Lets say you want to analyze a wallet that received 10 ETH from wallet A. The funding tree might show:

Wallet A flows to Your Target Wallet, which flows to a DEX Pool and Another Wallet.

This reveals:
1. Wallet A funded your target
2. Your target also sent funds to a DEX
3. Your target received funds from another wallet

## Key Metrics in Funding Tree Analysis

### 1. Number of Sources

Many sources suggest diversified activity. Few sources might indicate centralized control.

### 2. Source Types

Funds from exchanges are generally cleaner than funds from mixers or known scam addresses.

### 3. Flow Patterns

- Does money flow through many intermediaries?
- Is there a pattern of layering?
- Are funds being dispersed widely?

### 4. Timing Patterns

- All activity at similar times suggests automation
- Regular patterns suggest scheduled transactions

## Red Flags in Funding Trees

### High Risk Indicators

- **Mixer usage:** Any connection to mixers like Tornado Cash
- **Direct from exchange to mixer:** Attempting to hide the trail
- **New wallet with large inflows:** Could be newly created for scams
- **Circle of doom:** Funds cycling between same wallets
- **Direct from known scam:** Immediate red flag

### Medium Risk Indicators

- Many intermediaries making tracking difficult
- Interaction with known high-risk protocols
- Recent wallet age with significant activity

## Using FundTracers Funding Tree

FundTracer provides an interactive D3-powered funding tree visualization:

### Features

## Best Practices for Funding Tree Analysis

1. **Start shallow:** Begin with Level 1-2 before going deeper
2. **Check source types:** Focus on entity types, not just amounts
3. **Look for patterns:** Automated transactions have distinctive patterns
4. **Cross-reference:** Use multiple tools to verify findings
5. **Document your findings:** Save screenshots for compliance

## Understanding EVM vs Solana Architecture

The two largest smart contract platforms in crypto - Ethereum (and its EVM-compatible chains) and Solana - have fundamentally different architectures that affect how we trace transactions and analyze wallets.

## Key Architectural Differences

### 1. Account Model

**EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine):**
- Uses an Account-Based model
- Every address has: nonce, balance, storage root, code hash
- Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) vs Contract Accounts
- Explicit separation between wallet and contract

**Solana:**
- Uses a different model with Program-Derived Addresses (PDAs)
- Programs (smart contracts) can own accounts
- More complex account structure
- Multiple signatures possible per transaction

### 2. Transaction Structure

**EVM Transactions:**
- Include: nonce, gas price, gas limit, to address, value, data, signature
- Simpler structure
- One signature per transaction

**Solana Transactions:**
- Include: recent blockhash, fee, instructions
- Multiple instructions per transaction
- Multiple signers possible
- More complex but more flexible

### 3. Block Production

**EVM:**
- Block time: 12 seconds (Ethereum), varies on L2s
- Transactions ordered by gas price
- Mempool visible to all

**Solana:**
- Block time: 400ms (much faster)
- Leader-based ordering
- Different mempool characteristics

## Tracing Differences

### Wallet Analysis on EVM Chains

EVM chains are well-supported by tools like Etherscan and FundTracer:

- Complete transaction history visible
- ERC-20 token transfers easily tracked
- Contract interactions clearly logged
- Standard address format (0x...)
- Multiple EVM chains (Base, Arbitrum, Polygon, etc.)

### Wallet Analysis on Solana

Solana presents unique challenges:

- Different address format (base58)
- SPL tokens (vs ERC-20)
- Program interactions more complex
- PDA derivation different from traditional addresses
- Requires specialized tooling

### What Works Similarly

Both chains allow:
- Viewing transaction history
- Tracking token transfers
- Analyzing contract interactions
- Identifying wallet behavior patterns

## Supported Chains Comparison

| Feature | EVM (ETH, Base, Arbitrum, etc.) | Solana |
|---------|----------------------------------|--------|
| Address Format | 0x... | Base58 |
| Token Standard | ERC-20 | SPL |
| NFT Standard | ERC-721 | Metaplex |
| Block Time | 12s (ETH), faster L2s | 400ms |
| Tools Available | Many | Fewer, specialized |
| FundTracer Support | Full | Full |

## Cross-Chain Considerations

### EVM-Compatible Chains

With FundTracer, you can analyze:
- Ethereum
- Linea
- Base
- Arbitrum
- Optimism
- Polygon
- BSC

All share the same address format and EVM architecture.

### Solana Integration

Solana requires separate handling due to its unique architecture. FundTracer provides full support for Solana wallet analysis.

## Which Should You Use?

### Use EVM When:

- Working with DeFi protocols (Uniswap, Aave, etc.)
- Analyzing Ethereum-based tokens and NFTs
- Need broader tool availability
- Focus on compliance (EVM chains have more established AML frameworks)

### Use Solana When:

- Analyzing NFT activity (Solana has vibrant NFT ecosystem)
- Need faster block times for real-time analysis
- Working with Solana-specific protocols (Tensor, Magic Eden, etc.)
- Following specific Solana-native projects

## FundTracer Support

FundTracer provides comprehensive analysis for both:

- **EVM chains:** Full wallet analysis, transaction history, risk scoring
- **Solana:** Dedicated Solana analysis with SPL token tracking, NFT analysis

You can switch between chains seamlessly on our platform.

## Conclusion

While EVM and Solana have different architectures, both are traceable with the right tools. The key differences affect how data is presented but do not fundamentally prevent analysis.

The most important factor is using tools built for each specific chain. FundTracer supports both, allowing you to analyze wallets across the crypto ecosystem.

## Understanding Coordinated Wallet Activity

Coordinated wallet activity occurs when multiple wallets act in concert, whether intentionally (like a trading bot) or maliciously (like a Sybil attack). Detecting this coordination is crucial for security, compliance, and research.

## What is Coordinated Activity?

Coordinated activity means multiple wallets displaying synchronized behavior that suggests common control or coordination. This includes:

- **Same-block transactions:** Multiple wallets transacting within the same block
- **Shared funding sources:** Wallets funded from the same origin
- **Similar patterns:** Identical transaction timing, amounts, or destinations
- **Group behavior:** Acting together toward a common goal

## Why Detect Coordinated Activity?

### For Projects

- **Prevent Sybil attacks:** Stop fake users from inflating metrics
- **Fair airdrops:** Ensure tokens reach genuine users
- **Governance integrity:** Protect against vote manipulation

### For Investors

- **Avoid pump schemes:** Identify coordinated price manipulation
- **Due diligence:** Verify legitimate activity before investing
- **Risk assessment:** Understand true market dynamics

### For Compliance

- **AML requirements:** Identify potential money laundering
- **Investigation support:** Trace criminal fund flows
- **Reporting obligations:** Document suspicious activity

## Detection Methods

### 1. Temporal Analysis

**Same-Block Detection**

The most obvious indicator is multiple transactions in the same block:

Block 15,432,987:
- Wallet A -> DEX (0.5 ETH)
- Wallet B -> DEX (0.5 ETH)
- Wallet C -> DEX (0.5 ETH)
- Wallet D -> DEX (0.5 ETH)

This pattern strongly suggests coordination (likely automated).

**Timing Correlation**

Even without same-block activity, wallets with similar transaction timing are suspicious:

- Consistent intervals between transactions
- Same time of day patterns
- Synchronized with external events

### 2. Funding Analysis

**Common Source Detection**

Wallets funded from the same source are likely related:

Wallet A: funded by 0x1111...
Wallet B: funded by 0x1111...
Wallet C: funded by 0x1111...

**Funding Pattern Matching**

Similar funding patterns indicate common control:

- Same token received from same addresses
- Similar funding amounts and timing
- Cross-chain funding from same sources

### 3. Behavioral Clustering

**Transaction Similarity**

Wallets with identical transaction patterns:

- Same tokens transferred
- Same destination addresses
- Similar amounts
- Similar frequency

**Contract Interaction Patterns**

Similar DeFi interactions:

- Same protocols used
- Same transaction types
- Similar swap patterns

### 4. Network Analysis

**Cluster Identification**

Using graph theory to identify connected wallets:

- Central nodes connecting multiple wallets
- Dense subgraph connections
- Bridge wallets linking clusters

### 5. Machine Learning Approaches

Modern detection uses ML models trained on:

- Known Sybil clusters
- Labeled training data
- Pattern recognition
- Anomaly detection

## Practical Detection Steps

### Step 1: Gather Data

Collect transaction history for all wallets in question.

### Step 2: Temporal Analysis

Look for:
- Same-block transactions
- Timing correlations
- Periodic patterns

### Step 3: Funding Analysis

Trace fund sources:
- Common ancestors
- Shared funding patterns
- Cross-chain correlations

### Step 4: Behavioral Comparison

Compare:
- Token holdings
- Contract interactions
- Transaction types

### Step 5: Cluster Formation

Identify groups using:
- Graph analysis
- Similarity scores
- Machine learning

## Red Flags Summary

| Indicator | Risk Level |
|-----------|------------|
| Same-block transactions | High |
| Shared funding source | High |
| Identical patterns | High |
| Similar timing | Medium |
| Common contracts | Medium |
| Network connections | Medium |

## Conclusion

Detecting coordinated wallet activity requires analyzing multiple dimensions: timing, funding sources, behavior patterns, and network connections. The key is combining multiple detection methods rather than relying on any single indicator.

FundTracers Sybil detection does this automatically, scoring wallets based on multiple factors and identifying clusters of related addresses.
